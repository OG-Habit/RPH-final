    desc1: `"It appears in official documents that in this period Luna committed the greatest error of his life in denouncing the existence of the Katipunan and in revealing, during his imprisonment after the first outbreak of the rebellion, the names of some of his friends affiliated with the Society.`,
    desc2: `Later, he explained however to me his aforesaid acts by saying that with the physical and moral tortures which he suffered during his imprisonment, and upon being assured by the Spaniards that he had been squealed upon by his own friends, denouncing him as an accomplice in the rebellion, his violent character made him lose his better judgment."`

    desc1: `Luna, in a November 1896 affidavit, betrayed friends like Rizal, falsely linking the Katipunan to the earlier Liga Filipina. Rizal founded Liga, but it dissolved in 1892, and he wasn't involved in the radical Katipunan led by Bonifacio. Despite Rizal's unwitting honorary presidency in Katipunan, Luna implicated him, contributing to Rizal's unjust death sentence. Rizal, though not directly involved in armed resistance, inspired the Revolution through his life and works.`,

    This passage is very important because he was responsible for giving the names associated with Katipunan to the Spanish officials.`,
