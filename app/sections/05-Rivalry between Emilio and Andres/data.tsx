    description: `The Tejeros Convention in Cavite aimed to unite the Magdiwang and Magdalo branches of the Katipunan, addressing defense, setting up a revolutionary government, and resolving internal rivalry. Magdiwang, more supportive of Andres, faced off with Magdalo, led by the wealthy principalia, including Aguinaldo. Despite losing the top positions, Andres gracefully accepted the roles of President and Vice President. However, a dispute arose when Tirona challenged Bonifacio's credentials, suggesting a lawyer take the Interior Secretary role. This angered Bonifacio, who invalidated the convention and walked out with his supporters.`,

    name: "Acta de Tejeros",
    description: `This document is the Acta de Tejeros. And, it basically proclaims the Tejeros Convention as invalid due to lack of due process. It was written and signed one day after. Furthermore, the signatories rejected the republic instituted at the convention and reaffirmed their commitment to the Katipunan.`,

    name: "Acta de Naik",
    description: `A month later, the Acta de Naik was written and signed proclaiming that there are some leaders of the Katipunan who betrayed and committed treason. What made this document very important was that some of the signatories were Aguinaldoâ€™s own men including Pio del Pilar and Mariano Noriel who were the most senior generals. Another is Mariano Trias who was elected Vice President at the Tejeros Convention and had sworn his oath of office.

    name: "Pio del Pilar and Mariano Noriel",
    description: `According to historian Jim Richardson, when Aguinaldo discovered his men's maneuvers, he calmly visited Bonifacio at the Naik hacienda, where reports of his shifting loyalties were being read. Aguinaldo, unfazed, observed the faces of the supposed allies. Bonifacio invited him to listen, but Aguinaldo coolly stated, "If I were needed, you would have invited me," and left, stunning everyone.

    Aguinaldo's bold move convinced Pio del Pilar (left) and Mariano Noriel (right) to return to his camp. To prove loyalty, del Pilar testified against Bonifacio in a fake trial, while Noriel judged him guilty of treason.`,
